Manage different versions of a file 

Version Control ?
Distrubed. "branch"

1970s -> originalFile 
			track changes and save
			OF -> V5OF
			V1
			V2
			V3
			V4
			V5
1980s -> LatestCopy
			track changes and save
			LC -> OF
			V5(LC)
			V4
			V3
			V2
			V1 (OF)
hence foward

2003 -> Linux.. Kernel Millions of contributors... SCM... version control
Linux made use of a not source ... free Licensed

Linux community feared not open source software 

2006 : this came true. 

Linus Torvalds... Git (open source) -> manage Linux Kernels

different versions of version control software

Operating System

Layers

Desktop
GUI.
System Maintainance Applications
System Development
Kernel -> HW interaction, critical tasks of any OS

2007 -> 100
2008 -> K
2009 -> M

Version Control Manager

System Development

v1 -> server -> clients are using it
repository

workingCopy ?? 
	restore
	discardchanges
	addModifications
	and so on

v2 -> maintainance, bug fixing, feature adding, wearables integration

diff -> difference between object

any version control manager has a two tier architecture

Git has a three tier architecture.
	- working Directory
	- staging index
	- repo

	Linus Trovalds 

	levels 

	local files -> make changes
	staging -> staged
	repo -> commit
